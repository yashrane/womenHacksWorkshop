# WomenHacks Workshop: Intro to Deep Learning # 
Hosted on behalf by Data Science UCSB 

Welcome to the Deep Learning Workshop! Today we will be 
be taking you guys through a quick intro with the MNIST dataset. 
You can find the slide deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VxCSgp-6JI9b35YacHL0Pr-_vQ1DMCZYVZ0CpKr5L14/edit#slide=id.g4dc527decf_0_230 "slides"). 

Here's step by step of what to do before we start! 

**Using Google Colab (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/. 
2. Click the tab for Github
3. Enter the url for this repo and click "keras.ipynb"
4. You're ready to go!

**Using Anaconda**
1. Download the correct version of Anaconda Python 3.6 [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).

2. Install it and go through the steps. 

3. Once you've completed the installation, open up terminal and execute 
`$ python`and check that on the top it says `Anaconda` like so: 
    ![python](images/python.png "python")

4. Exit Python by holding `control` and pressing `d`

5. Now let's create an anaconda virtual environment: 

    `$ conda create -n DSWorkshop python=3.6` It will prompt you to verify some package dependencies and whatnot, type `y` and hit enter. 

6. Once it's created, let's activate the environment with 

    `$ source activate DSWorkshop`

7. Now let's clone this workshop repo! Go ahead and enter this: 

    ```
    cd ~/Desktop
    git clone https://github.com/calvin-is-seksy/womenHacksWorkshop.git
    cd womenHacksWorkshop
    ```
    
8. Let's install our packages! go ahead and run 
    
    `$ conda install --yes --file requirements.txt` It will again prompt you to verify some package dependencies and whatnot, type `y` and hit enter.
    
    NOTE: If this step doesn't work at all, run this: 
    
    ```
    $ conda install keras
    $ conda install matplotlib
    $ conda install jupyter
    ```

9. Do this for some safekeeping stuff just trust me on this: 
    
    `$ export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`
    
10. We're good to go! Let's open up a jupyter notebook. Run this: 

    `$ jupyter notebook`
    
11. Let's create a new notebook! 

    ![jupyter](images/jupyter.png "jupyter")
    
12. Now let's have some fun :)
